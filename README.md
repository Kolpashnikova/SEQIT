Visualizing Eye Gaze Sequences â€“ A CPSC 547 Project at UBC
=====
The code is organized as follow:
index.html:          the main page
/css/eyegazevis.css: the main stylesheet
/js/eyegazevis.js:   the main javascript file

other files in the /css and /js folders are external libraries that are used in the application.

Example dataset:
atuav2.tsv:             definitions of AOI
atuav2_example:         visual stimulus (a screenshot of the visualization task)
fixation_datasets.json: the main data file that contains the fixation data
user_chars.csv:         the user characteristic data (perceptual speed, verbal/visual working memory)

To run the application locally, start a server by executing
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
and then go to http://localhost:8000

The application is available at http://cs.ubc.ca/~mikewu/cs547/
